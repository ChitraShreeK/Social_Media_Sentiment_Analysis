      "\n",
      "* Submissions must be primarily news and developments relating to technology\n",
      "\n",
      "* [Self posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/wiki/self-post-guide) must contribute positively to /r/technology and foster reasonable discussion. Self-post cross-posts are not acceptable. Please message the moderators before attempting to submit a text/self post.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Submissions relating to business and politics must be sufficiently within the context of technology in that they either view the events from a technological standpoint or analyze the repercussions in the technological world.\n",
      "\n",
      "* ####Please do not submit the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "* i) Submissions violating the guidelines.\n",
      "\n",
      "* ii) Images, audio or videos: Articles with supporting image and video content are allowed; if the text is only there to explain the media, then it is not suitable. A good rule of thumb is to look at the URL; if it's a video hosting site, or mentions `video` in the URL, it's not suitable. \n",
      "\n",
      "* iii) Requests for tech support, questions or help: submit to /r/techsupport, /r/AskTechnology, another relevant community or our weekly [Support Saturday threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/search?q=flair%3ATechSupport&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all).\n",

      "* iv) Petitions, Surveys or Crowdfunding (Including ICOs) - submissions of this nature will be removed.\n",
      "\n",
      "* v) Submissions discussing the subreddit itself; they should be submitted to /r/TechnologyTalk, or [messaged to the moderators of the subreddit](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ftechnology).\n",
      "\n",
      "* vi) Submissions discussing one or more incidents of customer support.\n",

      "\n",
      "* viii) Social media links/profiles/invites or promotions (eg. Facebook, BlueSky, Instagram, Threads, etc). Tweets should not be used as a news source unless an official announcement by a verified company or spokesperson. \n",
      "\n",
      "##2. Behaviour\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Remember the human** You are advised to abide by [reddiquette](/wiki/reddiquette); it will be enforced when user behaviour is no longer deemed to be suitable for a technology forum. Remember; personal attacks, abusive language, trolling, bad-faith abusive comments, flaming and baiting, and bigotry/hate in any form are not allowed and will be removed and the user will be banned.\n",
      "\n",
      "##3. Titles\n",
      "\n",
      "* Submissions **must** use either the articles title and optionally a subtitle. Or, ***only*** if neither are accurate, a suitable quote, which must:\n",
      "\n",
      "* adequately describe the content\n",
      "\n",
      "* adequately describe the content's relation to technology\n",
